# Presentation Deck by Majo

### Accessibility Features
This presentation deck has been designed and built with accessibility in mind, adhering to modern web standards. Key accessibility features include:

- **WCAG-Compliant Color Contrast**: All text and background color combinations meet or exceed the WCAG AA standard, ensuring readability for users with low vision or color blindness.

-  **Keyboard Navigation**: The entire presentation can be navigated using only the keyboard (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Spacebar, and number keys 1-7).

-  **Dynamic aria-hidden Toggling**: Slides that are not active are hidden from screen readers, preventing them from reading irrelevant content
